# Receiving an on-chain transaction (swap-in)
There are cases when you have funds in some bitcoin address and you would like to send those to your lightning node.

<custom-tabs category="lang">
<div slot="title">Rust</div>
<section>

```rust,ignore
let swap_info = sdk.receive_onchain().await?;

// Send your funds to the below bitcoin address
let address = swap_info.bitcoin_address;
```

Once you've sent the funds to the above address, the SDK will monitor this address for unspent confirmed outputs and use a trustless submarine swap to receive these into your Lightning node. You can always monitor the status of the current in-progress swap using the following code:

```rust,ignore
let swap_info = sdk.in_progress_swap().await?
```

The process of receiving funds via an on-chain address is trustless and uses a submarine swap. This means there are two ways to spend the sent funds:

1. Either by a preimage that is exposed when the Lightning payment is completed - this is the positive case where the swap was successful.
2. Or by your node when the swap didn't complete within a certain timeout - this is the negative case where your node will execute a refund.

In order to execute a refund, you need to supply an on-chain address to where the refunded amount will be sent. The following code will retrieve the refundable swaps:

```rust,ignore
let refundables = sdk.list_refundables().await?
```

Once you have a refundable swap in hand, use the following code to execute a refund:

```rust,ignore
let destination_address = "...".into()
let sat_per_vbyte = <refund tx fee rate>
sdk.refund(refundable.bitcoin_address, destination_address, sat_per_vbyte).await?
```

# Calculating fees

<custom-tabs category="lang">

<div slot="title">Rust</div>
<section>

When the amount to be received exceeds the inbound liquidity of the node, a new channel will be opened by the LSP in order for the node to receive it. This can checked by retrieving the NodeState from the SDK and comparing the inbound liquidity to the amount to be received. If the amount is greater or equal to the inbound liquidity, a new channel opening is required.

To calculate the fees for a channel being opened by the LSP:

```rust,ignore
async fn calculate_channel_opening_fee(amount_msat: u64) -> Result<u64> {
    let channel_opening_fee_needed = is_channel_opening_fee_needed(amount_msat, sdk.clone())?;
    match channel_opening_fee_needed {
        true => calculate_fees_for_amount(amount_msat).await,
        false => Ok(0),
    }
}
```

How to detect if open channel fees are needed:
```rust,ignore
fn is_channel_opening_fee_needed(amount_msats: u64) -> Result<bool> {
    let node_info = sdk.node_info()?.ok_or(anyhow!("No node info found"))?;
    Ok(node_info.inbound_liquidity_msats <= amount_msats)
}
```

LSP fees are calculated in two ways, either by a minimum fee set by the LSP or by a fee per myriad calculated based on the amount being received. If the fee calculated from the fee per myriad is less than the minimum fee, the minimum fee is used.

This information can be retrieved for each LSP and then calculated:

```rust,ignore
async fn calculate_fees_for_amount(amount_msat: u64) -> Result<u64> {
    let lsp_id = sdk.lsp_id().await?.ok_or(anyhow!("No lsp id found"))?;
    let lsp_info = sdk
        .fetch_lsp_info(lsp_id)
        .await?
        .ok_or(anyhow!("No lsp id found"))?;

    // We calculate the dynamic fees in millisatoshis rounded to satoshis.
    let channel_dynamic_fee_msat =
        amount_msat * lsp_info.channel_fee_permyriad as u64 / 10_000 / 1000 * 1000;
    let fee_sat = max(
        lsp_info.channel_minimum_fee_msat as u64,
        channel_dynamic_fee_msat,
    );
    Ok(fee_sat)
}

        }
        return nil
    }
```

        do {
            let nodeInfo = try sdk.nodeInfo()
            
            if var liqudity = nodeInfo?.inboundLiquidityMsats{
                liqudity /= 1000
                print(liqudity)
                return amountStats >= liqudity

                let setupFee = lspInfo!.channelFeePermyriad / 100
                // minFee is the minimum fee required by the LSP to open a channel.
                let minFee = lspInfo!.channelMinimumFeeMsat / 1000
                
                // A setup fee of {setupFee}% with a minimum of {minFee} will be applied for sending more than {liquidity}.
