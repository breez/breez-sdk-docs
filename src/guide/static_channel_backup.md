# Exporting channels backup 

A Static Channel Backup (SCB) file is automatically generated by the Breez SDK in the background. More specifically, the SCB file is updated whenever a new channel is opened.

The SCB file can be used as a last resort to recover funds in case the Greenlight node becomes inaccessible ("doomsday" scenario). In order to recover the funds using the SCB information, users can initialize a new core lightning node with its [HSM secret](https://docs.corelightning.org/docs/hsm-secret) using their seed. Then, trigger a channel recovery through [the recoverchannel method](https://docs.corelightning.org/reference/lightning-recoverchannel) provided by CLN.

In order to use the recoverchannel method, the user needs to provide the SCB file. It can be retrieved from the SDK's working directory as follows:
