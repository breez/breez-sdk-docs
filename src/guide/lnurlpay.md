# Receiving payments using LNURL-Pay

Breez SDK users have the ability to receive Lightning payments using [LNURL-Pay](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/06.md).

LNURL-Pay requires a web service that serves LNURL-Pay requests. This service needs to communicate with the user node in order to fetch the necessary metadata data and the associated payment request.
To interact with the user node, the service uses a simple protocol over push notifications:
* The service sends a push notification to the user's mobile app with the LNURL-Pay request and a reply URL.
* The app responds to reply URL with the required data.
* The data is forwarded from the service to the payer.

## General workflow
![light-lnurlpay](https://github.com/breez/breez-sdk-docs/assets/5394889/f7cb25af-f534-4fd8-bb26-733bc285e0a2)


### Step 1: Registering for an LNURL-Pay service
Use a POST request to the service endpoint:

```
https://app.domain/lnurlpay/[pubkey]
```
With the following payload:

```
{
 "time": "seconds since epoch",
 "webhook_url": "notification service webhook url",
 "signature": "signed payload"
}
```

to register the app for an LNURL-Pay service.
The signature is refers to the following string: ```[time]-[webhook_url]``` where ```time``` and ```webhook_url``` are the payload fields.

The service responds with following payload: 
```>
{
 "lnurl": "https://app.domain.com/lnurlp/[pubkey]", 
}
```

### Step 2: Processing an LNURL-Pay request
When an LNURL-Pay request is triggered a GET request to:
```
https://app.domain.com/lnurlp/[pubkey]
```
The service then sends a push notification to the app with the LNURL-Pay request and a callback URL. Such payload may look like the following:

```
{
 "template": "lnurlpay_info",
 "data": {  
  "reply_url": https://app.domain.com/respond/<request_id>
  "callback_url": https://app.domain.com/lnurlpay/invoice
  }
}
```

The <b>reply_url</b> is used by the app to respond to the lnurlpay request.
The <b>callback_url</b> s the LNURL-Pay callback URL, used by the payer to fetch the invoice.

### Step 3: Responding to the callback url
When the app receives the push notification, it parses the payload and then uses the reply_url to respond with the required data, for example:

```
{
 "callback": "https://app.domain.com/lnurlpay/invoice",
 "maxSendable": 10000,
 "minSendable": 1000,
 "metadata": "[[\"text/plain\",\"Pay to Breez\"]]",
 "tag": "payRequest"
}
```

The service receives the response from the app and forwards it to the sender.

### Step 4: Fetching a bolt11 invoice

The sender fetchs a bolt11 invoice by invoking a GET request to the callback_url with adding a specific amount as a query parameter. For example: 
```
https://app.domain.com/lnurlpay/invoice?amount=1000
```
An additional push notification is triggered to send the invoice request to the app. Then the app replied with the bolt11 invoice data.

### Step 5: Paying the invoice
In the last step, the payer pays the received bolt11 invoice. Follow the steps [here](payment_notification.md) to receive payments via push notifications.
