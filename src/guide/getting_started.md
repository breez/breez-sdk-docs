# Getting started

The Breez SDK enables mobile developers to integrate Lightning and bitcoin payments into their apps with a very shallow learning curve. The use cases are endless â€“ from social apps that want to integrate tipping between users to content-creation apps interested in adding bitcoin monetization. Crucially, this SDK is an end-to-end, non-custodial, drop-in solution powered by Greenlight, a built-in LSP, on-chain interoperability, third-party fiat on-ramps, and other services users and operators need.

The Breez SDK provides the following services:

* Sending payments (via various protocols such as: bolt11, keysend, lnurl-pay, lightning address, btc address, etc.)
* Receiving payments (via various protocols such as: bolt11, lnurl-withdraw, btc address, etc.)
* Fetching node status (e.g. balance, max allow to pay, max allow to receive, on-chain balance, etc.)
* Connecting to a new or existing node.

Connecting to a node requires a seed (your master key). The seed is a bip39 mnemonic.

## Pricing

The Breez SDK is free for developers. 

## API Key and Invite Code

Before you start, you will need an API Key to use the SDK, as well as an Invite Code when you create a new node.

To get both of them, please contact Breez via email at <contact@breez.technology> or at <https://breez.technology/#contact-us-form>
